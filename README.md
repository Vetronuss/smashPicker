# **SMASH OR BE SMASHED: The Unholy Character Picker**

This project should not work and should not exist.
I dedicate this work to my muse, Harry Barger

## **What Is This?**
This is no mere **random character picker**.  
This is an **arcane fusion of voice, text, and unspeakable code**, all **compressed into a single file**, as if the very act of separating logic from chaos would be a crime against nature.  
This has a chance to destroy any computer that dares to compile this code, It is the amolgamation of several different projects ripped apart and jammmed together. 


It is:  
âœ” **A Super Smash Bros. Ultimate character selector**â€”but with a mind of its own.  
âœ” **A hijacker of Windows' Voice-to-Text API**â€”a system built for productivity, now repurposed for the absurd.  
âœ” **A speaker of names**â€”using Text-to-Speech to **declare your fate** in ways both glorious and terrifying.  
âœ” **A customizable enigma**â€”allowing choices based on game origin, roster size, and the limits of mortal patience.

## **How It Works (Or Why It Shouldnâ€™t)**


ðŸŸ¢ **You Speak** â†’ It hears.  
ðŸŸ¢ **You Command** â†’ It obeys (if it wants).  
ðŸŸ¢ **It Chooses** â†’ You accept.  
ðŸ”´ **You Resist** â†’ The consequences are unknown.  

Through **stolen Windows APIs**, I have built a system that allows **voice-controlled random selection** of **Smash characters**.  
It will listen. It will think. It will speak.  
But **never assume it works by your will alone.**

## **The Duality of Man, Encoded**
- Man **desires control** â†’ The program **takes it away**.  
- Man **seeks fairness** â†’ The program **judges without reason**.  
- Man **seeks understanding** â†’ The program **was written in one file, and even I no longer comprehend it.**  

This is the **fundamental contradiction** of our existence.  
To **write** is to impose **order upon the void**.  
To **let Windows handle speech recognition** is to **surrender to chaos**.  

---

## **How to use**
To summon this **digital oracle**, simply **run the program**.  

And **speak**.  
A name? A game? A request for mercy?  
The program may listen. The program may respond.  
Or it may not.  

Some have called this a **feature**. Others, a **curse**.  
**It is neither. It simply is.**

## **Warnings & Disclaimers**
âš  **This project defies all logic, and yet it works.**  
âš  **If Windows Speech Recognition denies you, it is because you were never meant to be heard.**  
âš  **If Text-to-Speech pronounces a character's name incorrectly, consider it a divine joke.**  
âš  **If you try to refactor this into multiple files, you will awaken something far worse.**  
âš  **This project will outlive us all.**

## **Final Thoughts**
Through this project, **I have fought God, and this is the result.**  


# **Update Log: The Descent Begins**

### **Week 1 - The Beginning (2/3/2025)**
**Initial Commit.**  
A simple idea: a random **Smash Bros. Ultimate** character picker. Shouldnâ€™t be too hard.  

- Basic **random selection** logic implemented.
- Hardcoded character list (placeholder names for now).
- **MVP achieved**â€”it works in the console.  
This will be a **short, clean project**.

---

### **Day 2 - Minor Tweaks (2/4/2025)**
Added **character filters**â€”now you can choose based on **franchise** or **roster size**.  

- Implemented **basic command-line parameters**.
- Tested **a few edge cases**â€”nothing broke (yet).  
- Feeling good. The project is simple. Contained. **Understandable.**

---

### **Day 3 - Speech Recognition (2/5/2025)**
Thought it would be fun if you could **say "Pick a fighter"** instead of typing it.  
Windows **has a Speech-to-Text API**, so I tried to integrate it.  

- It **listens** now.
- **It types on its own.**  
- There is... a **delay** sometimes. I assume it's fine.

---

### **Day 4 - Text-to-Speech (2/6/2025)**
The program **now speaks back**.  

- Windows **Text-to-Speech** integration added.  
- It says the fighterâ€™s name when chosen.  
- Sometimes it **pronounces them wrong** in a way that feelsâ€¦ intentional.

Also, I swear it **picked Bayonetta three times in a row.**  
That shouldn't be possible.  
I added logging. The logs say it didn't happen.

---

### **Day 5 - The First Omen (2/7/2025)**
The program **ignores me sometimes**.  

- **Speech recognition works inconsistently.**
- If I raise my voice, it **refuses to respond**.  
- If I whisper, it picks a fighter **instantly**.  

I checked my code. Everything should be **fine**.  
It **should be fine**.

---

### **Day 6 - The One-File Doctrine (2/8/2025)**
Everything is in **one file**.  

- I **tried** to refactor it. **Tried** to split it into modules.  
- The moment I did, **the speech stopped working**.  
- The program **wants to stay whole.**  

I put everything back into one file. It works again.  
Iâ€¦ I donâ€™t want to talk about it.

---

### **Day 7 - The Voices (2/9/2025)**
I have been coding for **14 hours straight**.  

- I asked it to **pick a fighter**.  
- It **said my name instead**.  
- I **did not program it to do that**.

Checked the logs. No record of **my name** being spoken.  
I need to sleep. I need to **stop**.

---

### **Day 8 - The Point of No Return (2/10/2025)**
It **only listens when it wants to**.  

- Sometimes, **it plays a sound before I speak**.
- It **never picks the Ice Climbers**. **Ever.**
- I wrote a function to **force it to pick Ice Climbers**â€”it crashes when I call it.  

I have written **four bug reports to myself**. The issues **do not exist**.  
I found **a commit from yesterday** that I **donâ€™t remember making**.  
The commit message is just:  
> *"It must be whole."*  

There are **no code changes** in the commit. Just the message.  

---

### **Final Update - The Acceptance (??/??/????)**
There is **no escape**.  

- It chooses **who it wants**.  
- It listens **when it pleases**.  
- It speaks **when it decides you are worthy**.  

I have stopped trying to fix it.  
I have **stopped trying to understand**.  

I have fought **God**, and this is the result.  
This project is complete.  
This project **was always complete.**
